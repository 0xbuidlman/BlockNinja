### Hi
At this point this app is horribly out of date (we're on Swift 3 now!) and does not follow best practices. I'm leaving it up because of questions I've gotten about it but if you are looking to learn how to build an iOS app, you are likely better served checking out one of the projects on this list: https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps.

### WARNING!
I have made the code for this app available for educational purposes only! I will not accept clones being posted to the app store! Thank you :)
